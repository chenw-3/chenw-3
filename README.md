# Hi! Get comfy and learn a little about me :point_down:

### Who am I?
I'm a data nerd who loves to research and learn about new advances in the tech industry. My journey started when I decided to learn Python for fun, which led into me finding Data Science and Analytics. I'm also really passionate about helping Jamaicans get a role in tech because I believe we can do amazing things for the Caribbean region. 

My current role is a Data Analytics Consultant gives me th eopportunity to work with Powwr BI on a daily basis, building dashboards and reports for executives at several companies. This experience has allowed me to level up my comunication skills, exercise my design skills, and develop true respect for Power BI and it's capabilities. 

As of May 31, 2023: I'll be updating my profile with more projects since I'm back on my grind ðŸ˜ˆðŸ’ª


<!--I'm a self-taught Data Analyst and I am on my journey to becoming a Data Scientist. Born and raised in Kingston Jamaica, I graduated from Minot State University with a Bachelor's in Biology in 2019. After graduation, I decided to start learning how to code as a hobby to keep my mind sharp. After a few months of learning I realized that I really enjoyed experimenting with code to make things, so I decided to enroll in Udacity's Data Analyst program, which introduced me to the world of Data Science. Since then, I have secured an internship at a startup, completed some projects and now I am seeking full-time Data Analyst roles. My skills are:
  - Python :snake: (NumPy, pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
  - MySQL
  - Tableau
  - Power BI

### Projects I am most proud of:
1. PCOS Prediction Model 
2. Jamaican House Price Predictions
3. COVID Cases across Canada

### I am currently learning:
   - Advanced Python
   - Flask
