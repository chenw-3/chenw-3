# Hi! Get comfy and learn a little about me :point_down:

### Who am I?
I'm a self-taught Data Analyst and I am on my journey to becoming a Data Scientist. Born and raised in Kingston Jamaica, I graduated from Minot State University with a Bachelor's in Biology in 2019. After graduation, I decided to start learning how to code as a hobby to keep my mind sharp. After a few months of learning I realized that I really enjoyed experimenting with code to make things, so I decided to enroll in Udacity's Data Analyst program, which introduced me to the world of Data Science. Since then, I have secured an internship at a startup, completed some projects and now I am seeking full-time Data Analyst roles. My skills are:
  - Python :snake: (NumPy, pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
  - MySQL
  - Tableau
  - Power BI

### Projects I am most proud of:
1. PCOS Prediction Model 
2. Jamaican House Price Predictions
3. COVID Cases across Canada

### I am currently learning:
   - Advanced Python
   - Flask
    
### Feel free to reach out to me @Williamschennel@gmail.com for any questions!
